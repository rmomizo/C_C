6,6,"the diaphragm is a large muscle that stretches across your entire torso, just below your lungs.",0,staging
7,7,it moves up and down to help your lungs inhale and exhale the air you breathe.,0,staging
8,8,a hiccup occurs when the diaphragm experiences a spasm.,0,staging
9,9,"youve probably felt your arm or leg muscles spasm, when they kind of twitch without you doing anything to make that happen.",0,staging
10,10,"when the diaphragm spasms, it causes a quick intake of breath.",0,staging
11,11,but that breath is stopped quickly because the vocal cords in your throat close.,0,staging
12,12,the resulting turbulence of air in your throat makes the sound of a hiccup.,0,staging
13,13,so why does the diaphragm spasm?,1,inviting
14,14,one of the main causes is a full stomach.,0,staging

17,17,"if they go on for a longer period of time, your abdomen may start to hurt.",0,staging
